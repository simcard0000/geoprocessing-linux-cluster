# geoprocessing-linux-cluster
🌲 Configuration for some high-processing power geo shenanigans~

## What're we trying to do?
Ben's got big GIS (geographic information system) plans and some laptops; so the goal is to create a [Beowulf cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster):
> A Beowulf cluster is a computer cluster of what are normally identical, commodity-grade computers networked into a small local area network with libraries and programs installed which allow processing to be shared among them. The result is a high-performance parallel computing cluster from inexpensive personal computer hardware. The name Beowulf originally referred to a specific computer built in 1994 by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker at NASA.
